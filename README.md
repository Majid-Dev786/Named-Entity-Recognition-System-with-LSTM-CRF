# Named Entity Recognition System with LSTM-CRF

## Description

This Named Entity Recognition (NER) System leverages a sophisticated LSTM-CRF model to accurately identify and classify named entities in text. 
The combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) allows for effective learning of both the sequence and context of words, leading to superior tagging performance. 
This project is an essential tool for extracting meaningful information from texts, applicable in various real-world scenarios.

## Installation

To install and run this Named Entity Recognition System, follow these steps:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/Majid-Dev786/Named-Entity-Recognition-System-with-LSTM-CRF.git
cd Named-Entity-Recognition-System-with-LSTM-CRF
pip install torch TorchCRF sklearn
\`\`\`

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries: \`torch\`, \`TorchCRF\`, and \`sklearn\`.

## Usage In the Real World Scenario

This NER system can be applied to various types of texts to extract entities like names, locations, organizations, and others. Here's how to use it in a Python script:

\`\`\`python
from Named_Entity_Recognition_System_with_LSTM_CRF import NER

# Initialize and run the NER system
ner_system = NER()
ner_system.run()
\`\`\`

## Features

- **LSTM-CRF Model**: Combines LSTM's ability to capture long-term dependencies with CRF's strength in sequence prediction.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjustable parameters for different dataset sizes and complexities.
- **Real-World Data Handling**: Includes preprocessing and data handling for real-world application scenarios.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comes with functionality to evaluate and print model performance on validation data.

## Real-World Application Scenarios
